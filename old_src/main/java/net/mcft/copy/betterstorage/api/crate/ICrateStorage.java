	// You can see which exact items are stored within the crate
	// using the getContents() and getRandomStacks() methods and
	// use the stacks returned to extract these items. Do not
	// modify stacks returned by these methods.

	// Storage crates are supposed to be random and less efficient,
	// as a downside to their ability to expand and store lots of
	// items. Therefore, where possible / it makes sense, it's
	// recommended to use getRandomStacks(). Look at a few items
	// every tick (or a different interval) and give up if none
	// matched the requirements. This encourages players to keep
	// the number of different items within a crate low.

	// If this is not possible, it's recommended to balance things
	// by for example increasing resource or energy cost, perhaps
	// depending on the number of unique items.
